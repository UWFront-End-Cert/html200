        <p>Forty-plus years ago, four University of Washington students launched KCMU from the humblest of beginnings. In a tiny space in the basement of the Communications Building — with an even tinier budget — the radio station’s first broadcast just barely reached The Ave.</p>
        <p>That was in 1972. Fast-forward to 2015, and KEXP (renamed after a gift from Seattle’s Experience Music Project) is widely regarded as one of the best independent radio stations in the nation — and around the world. It was KEXP, after all, that first played Nirvana’s debut album Bleach on the air. In fact, Kurt Cobain dropped off the demo for the grunge band’s premiere single, “Love Buzz,” himself.</p>
        <p>And not much has changed since Cobain knocked on the station’s door back in 1988. KEXP continues to champion the underground sounds they truly care about, helping catapult the careers of up-and-coming musicians, and artists and labels continue to deliver physical copies of their work — most of which eventually land in KEXP’s music library, dubbed “the heart of the station” by iSchool graduate and KEXP librarian Dylan Flesch, ’08, ’14.</p>
        <p>The curated library houses more than 40,000 CDs and 10,000 LPs across rows and rows of shelves, and as the station’s first official keeper of them, Flesch is charged with a daunting task: keeping up with the ever-growing collection that’s at risk due to the simple nature of format — and playback equipment — obsolescence.</p>            
        <p>Take Pinwheel (Death Cab for Cutie frontman Ben Gibbard’s 90s punk project), for example, who did a live performance for KEXP 20 years ago that was captured on a digital audio tape. If digital audio tape recordings like that — which only exist in physical form — aren’t ripped to a hard drive soon, they could be lost history.</p>
