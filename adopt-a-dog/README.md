# Overview

This website for a fictional dog adoption agency was created as a portfolio project for the University of Washington certificate program in front-end web development. It builds on the basic HTML and CSS skills taught in the program by adding responsive design and JavaScript elements.

# User Personas

This site was designed with these personas as typical users.

## Persona 1: Mary

Mary is a newly married woman in her late 20s. She has a bachelor's degree, a professional office job and lives in a rented apartment in the city with her husband. They have no children, but would like to add a dog to their new family. To find a dog, she prefers browsing available dogs online rather than visiting an adoption agency in person. She primarily uses her phone to browse. If she finds a dog she likes, she would adopt directly online, not in person.

## Persona 2: Frank

Frank is 67 and recently retired. He lives with this wife in the suburbs. He is comfortable browsing the internet. He uses a laptop and occasionally a tablet, but doesn't browse websites using his phone. He uses the site to look at available dogs, but does not feel comfortable adopting directly online. Instead he would prefer to find a dog online, visit it in person, and adopt it while visiting.

## Persona 3: Judith

Judith loves dogs and already owns two of them. She has no immediate plans to adopt another dog, but she enjoys passing time by browsing available dogs and reading about being a dog owner. Her goal is not to adopt a new do but to be a part of the dog-lover community. She wants to help others adopt dogs. She would consider temporarily fostering a dog if needed. She primarily uses her phone to view the site.
