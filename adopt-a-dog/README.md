User Persona for Adopt-A-Dog

User 1: Tammy Chu

Job title: Client Manager at Nordstrom
Responsibilities: Tammy is a mid-level professional who interfaces with retail vendors
interested in selling on her company's website. Her job is to negotiate contracts and help her clients
set up and sell on the site. She works with internal teams to make sure her brands
are well stocked and get the right exposure to advertising and marketing opportunities.

Demographics:
27 years old
Single and rents a one-bedroom apartment in a newly built condo in Belltown.
Holds a BS in Business Administration from the University of Washington

Goals and Preferences:
Tammy is an urban native who enjoys living within walking distance of both work and
most amenities. In her free time, she loves to explore the Northwest and is often
hiking or camping when the weather permits it. She also enjoys yoga and music festivals.
She's looking for a dog for companionship and sees herself bringing her dog to work
as well as along with her on her many weekend adventures. She had a dog growing up and so is familiar
with common dog breeds and knows a bit about training and caring essentials, but this is her first pet that she's
owned on her own. She prefers premium breeds and is interested in a smaller dog that
will be comfortable in an office and that will look cute tucked inside her
new dog-toting bag.

Environment:
She is comfortable with technology on most devices but prefers to shop on her iPhone.
While at work and at home, she uses a laptop and has access to reliable, fast internet. She's
accustomed to online shopping and browsing and expects full functionality and responsiveness.
She is well versed in online transactions as well as best practices in e-commerce given
her professional experience. She has high expectations of site performance and dependability.
She most commonly uses Chrome on her laptops and either iOS Safari or Chrome on mobile.


Testing for Adopt-A-Dog
For initial responsiveness tests, I used Chrome DevTools to view my web site on iphone and across other common devices. I then reviewed my site using Window Resizer Chrome extension.

I then reviewed my site in these browsers on my Mac laptop: Chrome and Safari . On my android phone, I reviewed the site in Chrome. On my home desktop (PC), I reviewed it in Internet Explorer. I also had a friend take screenshots of my site using her iPhone  and within the Safari browser.

Change I made during the testing process:
-I changed the footer on mobile to streamline and simplify and make it easier to use the links.
-I continued to refine and edit the images, including the blog images (removing the float and increasing width on mobile) as well as refining the boxes and background image to make it look better on different devices. The images still look a bit funny on IE (blurry and the background image shows a gap between header and nav) but the site is much improved on other browsers.
-I started a hamburger menu but unfortunately, couldn't get it to completely work properly (so disregard for now).
-I swapped in the svg files for logo/cart icon and played with the sizes to help with their appearance on different screen sizes.
