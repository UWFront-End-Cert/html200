About John\
\
John is a caring person looking to make a difference. He has never been married, currently has no kids. Often finds donating to casques he believes in is one priority in life. John is looking to share his life experiences with someone rather than himself. Recently, he has turned to online shopping to avoid the hassle of asking questions in pet stores, rather will love to connect with pets through their difficult journeys. He loves hiking but alone is not fun since his stories are kept to himself. Having a great partner to share his journeys with is his new motive. \
