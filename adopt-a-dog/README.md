#Adopt-A-Dog README

##About
The Adopt-A-Dog website is written in HTML5, CSS and Javascript with aid from the JQuery 3.7.1 version on Windows 10 with Visual Studio Code v1.84. Uploaded to GitHub and hosted using GitHub's Pages feature.

Adopt-A-Dog is a mockup website for selecting and paying for dog adoptions. It is meant to demonstrate the programmer's newfound learning of HTML, CSS and Javascript after completing UW's online HTML5200 course. This is not a real website for a real company.
