Testing

During my testing process I checked my website on Google Chrome using the DevTools option. With the DevTool I clicked through all of the resizing options to see how my website looked in different sizes. 

After checking my website on my laptop, I sent the link to my iPhone and used the Safari browser. I also sent my link to my friend who owns a PC and they checked my website on Microsoft Edge. They told me that my website was responsive and didn’t see anything wrong with it. 


Changes made after looking at my website on different devices, I decided to hide the shopping cart and checkout button when it is displayed on an iPad or iPhone. I put in the CSS code for visibility hidden but the checkout section wouldn’t disappear. Furthermore, when looking at the website on my phone browser the widths of my header, nav bar and footer were correct but when I checked on the Inspect on my Google Chrome they were off. I tried a few different ways to fix it but nothing worked. Also I can’t figure out how to fix the unnecessary space in-between my header, article, and footer.
