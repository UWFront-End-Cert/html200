USER PERSONAS ------------------------------------------------------------------

Adopt a Dog is based in Seattle, a really pet friendly city, where almost everybody loves dogs. Therefore, the user base for the website has a pretty big range, from old people looking to adopt another pet, to couples looking to own their first dog together. The range of people being so large means users will be accessing the page from a plethora of devices (Desktops, Laptops, New Phones, Old Phones, Tablets, etc) and web browsers (Chrome, Safari, IE, Edge, Firefox and many more).There is no big difference in the amount of people using mobile vs desktop but the majority of users do use Chrome to access the website.

Here are two completely different examples of user personas that could belong to that user base.

TESTING ------------------------------------------------------------------------

I personally tested the Adopt a Dog website on six different browsers on two different devices (Surface Laptop and iPhone 8) apart from emulating different tablets and phones using the developer tools in both Chrome and Safari. I asked a friend to test the website on her MAC since I only have access to PCs. Also tested the website with different internet connections, didn't seem to make a noticeable difference

Laptops-------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Takes a long time to load the whole page.

- Overall the page runs well but it's pretty slow.

CHANGES MADE--------------------------------------------------------------------

- Lowered resolution of images, didn't make Chrome load faster. I think it has more to do with the way Chrome uses RAM rather than internet speed.
- Tried fixing checkout elements not being positioned as intended, didn't seem to work.
- Fixed elements not looking correctly when zooming out.
